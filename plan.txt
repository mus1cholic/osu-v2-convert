two pointers:

pointer 1 traverses through each entry of compressed replay data (start from after negatives are done)
pointer 2 traverses through each entry of hitobjects of target map.

main loop (incrementing pointer 1):

continue if no keys are pressed

if some type of key is pressed, record the key that is pressed.

check if circle, slider, or spinner

(for circle) check if hit at wrong position relative to cs, resulting in miss

(for circle) check if hit too early or too late, resulting in miss

(for circle) check when it hit, and update corresponding combo + accuracy

(for slider) check if hit too early or too late, resulting in miss

(for slider) check if hit at wrong position relative to cs, resulting in miss

(for slider) check for sliderticks, somehow????

(for spinner) check if hit too late

(for spinner) check how much is spinned ????

increment pointer 2


need to take account for

hitting too early, resulting in a miss
hitting too late, resulting in a miss
